      <h2>About Arma Automotive</h2>
      <p> Arma Automotive is a kit car design and manufacturing company based in Victoria, BC. During my time with them I managed both automotive and manufacturing based projects, including the design of a windshield wiper system for the prototype Arma GT car. Beyond this, I redesigned a concept for a constant centre steady rest (a tube work-holding device) utilized on the CNC Tube Bender, as well as designing Contractor style racks, bed rails and offroad bumpers for various models of Trucks and SUVâ€™s. </p>
      
     <p> Arma Automotive has provided a rich learning environment, somewhat like a design sandbox. This design experience was bolstered by my exposure to new software, manufacturing tools like plasma cutters, CNC bending and cutting technology, and welding experience.

        <h3>Windshield Wiper System Design</h3>
    </div>
    
    

  <div class="project-info">
      <p> The design of the windshield wiper system for the Arma GT required conforming to regulations, which allow for the registration of the completed vehicle, while also designing within the nearly finalized car. This posed extreme space constraints, and limited mounting position availability. Despite the challenging constraints, a design was created allowing for both wipers to be driven from a singular motor. This design is contrary to conventional windshield wipers in that the wipers are driven by independent pull or push rods, whereas most conventional designs link each wiper with a single rod. This allowed for the efficient packaging of this windshield wiper system.  </p>
