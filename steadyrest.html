          <h2>About Arma Automotive</h2>
          <div class="project-info">
          <p> Arma Automotive is a kit car design and manufacturing company based in Victoria, BC. During my time with them I managed both automotive and manufacturing based projects, including the design of a windshield wiper system for the prototype Arma GT car. Beyond this, I redesigned a concept for a constant centre steady rest (a tube work-holding device) utilized on the CNC Tube Bender, as well as designing Contractor style racks, bed rails and offroad bumpers for various models of Trucks and SUVâ€™s. </p>
          
         <p> Arma Automotive has provided a rich learning environment, somewhat like a design sandbox. This design experience was bolstered by my exposure to new software, manufacturing tools like plasma cutters, CNC bending and cutting technology, and welding experience.

      <div class="project-info">
          <p> Arma Automotive utilizes a CNC Tube Notcher to manufacture tube designs. The existing design for the tube holding device did not allow free rotation of the held tube and provided poor accuracy of cuts due to the mathematical inaccuracy of the centerline at various diameters of tubes. My redesign solved these problems, and implemented a wider diameter range, with easier tube loading.   </p>

            font-weight: bold;
   
          }
        </style>

        <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 70px"> <span class="special-text">My redesigned version provided all of the following features: </span></p>
        
          <style>
            ul {
              list-style-type: circle; /* You can change this to 'square', 'disc', etc. */
              padding-left: 150px; /* Adjust the amount of indentation as needed */
            }

            li {
              text-align: left; /* Left-justify the text */
            }
          </style>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Smooth tube rotation from implementing roller bearings.</li>
            <li>Mathematically accurate constant centers across diameters of tube from 1 to 2.5 inches.</li>
            <li>Improved material loading features such as a multi-stepped latch.</li>
            <li>Smoother operation of the slider mechanisms.</li>
          </ul>

   
          
          <p> As an added advantage, the design is fully manufacturable with sheet metal parts and off the shelf components. This allowed for the cost effective production of the product as a whole. </p>

<!--          <p>  In addition to the design of the windspeed probe, I participated in all aspects of the mechanical design of the consumer product itself. This includes 3D modelling in Fusion360, Design for Additive manufacturing with 3D Systems MJP 2500 Printers, Manufacturing SOP design and documentation. My efforts resulted in the reduction of overall weight and footprint of the sensor, while being able to implement new features, and hugely improved accuracy. </p>-->
