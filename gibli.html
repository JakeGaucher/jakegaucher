    <p>During my time as a Mechanical Designer at GiBLI Tech, I was involved in the design of an aerodynamic sensing system for cyclists. In addition to the design of the windspeed probe, I participated in all aspects of the mechanical design of the consumer product itself. </p>

    <h3>Windspeed Probe Design</h3>
    

  <div class="project-info">
      <p> The design of the sensor involved CFD simulation of various geometries of sensor probe throughout the prototyping stages. By calculating the error in the simulated measurements, compared to the simulated wind conditions, a quantitative analysis of the design was able to be used to determine an adequate and novel solution. The design for the wind speed probe was converged upon and implemented, while integrating a separate sensing geometry to measure wind angle independently of the wind speed probe. In implementing this design, the average 24% error in CdA was reduced to less than 1% on average in simulations. This design was included in the patent filed by GiBLI Tech, of which I was a part of the filing process.  </p>
